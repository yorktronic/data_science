# Data Science! #

## Let's learn some data science ##

This repo is focused exclusively on my adventure learning data science tools and techniques, including but not limited to: Python, SQLite, pandas, numPy, sciPy, Hadoop, and whatever else I come across that I'm supposed to learn!

Currently I'm enrolled in Thinkful's Data Science course, and you'll find my coursework and projects in the thinkful folder. There are other data sciency things in the root folder of my github, such as my <a href="https://github.com/yorktronic/hots-comp-calc" target-"_blank">Heroes of the Storm team comp calculator</a>, or using optimization techniques to <a href="https://github.com/yorktronic/wedding" target="_blank">plan food quantities for my wedding</a>.

My data science blog can be found <a href="http://yorktronic.io" target="_blank">here.</a>

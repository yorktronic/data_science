# Data Science! #

This repo is focused exclusively on my adventure learning data science while enrolled in the Thinkful.com data science program,
and the tools and techniques necessary to perform data-science-related tasks. This includes, but is not
limited to: python, SQLite, pandas, numPy, sciPy, dato's graphlab create and sframe, time series analysis,
 statistical analysis and plots, regression and classifation, random forests, decision trees, k nearest neighbors, etc.

There are other data sciency things in the root folder of my github, such as my
<a href="https://github.com/yorktronic/hots-comp-calc" target-"_blank">Heroes of the Storm team comp calculator</a>,
using optimization techniques to <a href="https://github.com/yorktronic/wedding" target="_blank">plan food quantities
for my wedding</a>, and my work for <a href="https://github.com/yorktronic/coursera-ml-foundations">Coursera's machine
learning specialization</a>.

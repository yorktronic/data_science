## Let's learn some data science ##

This repo is focused exclusively on my adventure learning data science tools and techniques, including but not limited to: Python, SQLite, pandas, numPy, sciPy, Hadoop, and whatever else I come across that I'm supposed to learn!

Currently I'm enrolled in Thinkful's Data Science course, which is pretty much the only thing I'm working on in terms of producing actual code.

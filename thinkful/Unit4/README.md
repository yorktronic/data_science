# Metrics and Cross Validation #

## Objective ##

Perform a KFold cross validation of the linear regression model I built in Unit2 to project interest rates offered by Lending Club based on loan term length and FICO credit score. Of all the models I built I got the best results from loan term and FICO score.

## Results ##

`Mean Absolute Error: 0.0184240820785`
`Mean Squared Error: 0.000542170328631`
`R Squared: 0.68927852421`

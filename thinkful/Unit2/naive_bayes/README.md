# Naive Bayes #
The Bayesian notion of probability can be expressed as follows: 

> posterior probability = (conditional probability x prior probability) / evidence

Or, in english

If this doesn't make sense, and it didn't for me even though I studied this crap in college, watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLcgeLALLnc" target="_blank">Probability 7</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVr8snbaxZg" target="_blank"> Probability 8</a> of Khan Academy's videos on the topic.

<strong>Bayesian inference</strong> introduces prior probability interpreted as prior belief or knowledge, which in turn describe the general probability of encoutering a particular class.

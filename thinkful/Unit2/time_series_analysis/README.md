# Time Series Modeling #
My task was to take Lending Club data for all of 2014 and perform an analysis on the number of loans per month. Specifically, I am to answer the questions: 

1. **Is the time series of loans per month stationary?** Answer: yes, the time series is stationary. Though there is autocorrelation across all lags, it diminishes after month 5 or so and becomes relatively steady. If the series were non-stationary, it would needed to be differenced.
2. **Are there any autocorrelated structures in the series? How would you have a model address these structures?** There are significant autocorrelated structures at month 1, 2, and 3. I would likely take a moving average to match the these lags. Additionally, it might be useful (given that I have historical information on previous years), to see if there's a seasonal component at play here. Given that the spikes are in January, March, and April, I'd like to explore whether there is a larger quantity of debt consolidation loans during these months. Since they are just after the holiday season :)

Time series - dependent variable that we observe on a regular basis vs. cross-section @ all time, lots of different units of variation

horizontal pattern - data seems to fluctuate around a mean
trend pattern - random fluctuation but it's over a constant trend
seasonal pattern - repeating pattern over successive periods
cyclical pattern - high runs and low runs

patterns can be a combination of these

A series of Y's influenced by: 
t - time
seasonality - short term periodic relationship between Y and t
cycles - long term periodic relationship
irregular relationship - unobservable time-dependent influences (error)

Not looking @ causal relationships

Forecasting Methods
Forecasting Accuracy
Forecast error - actual value minus forecast (for purpose of instruction)

Lesson 2

Naive Forecast - whatever happened last period will happen this period
-----------------
Ft+1 = Yt

mean absolute error (MAE) = sum of the absolute value of the forecast errors / the number of forecasts

mean square error (MSE) = sum of (Yt - Ft)^2 / # of forecasts

percentage error = (Yt - Ft) / Yt

abs

mean absolute percentage error (MAPE)= sum of abs (from above) divided by # of forecasts

average of past values = sum of past observed values / number of observed values
does a pretty good job of data that sticks around a trend / average 
-----------------------
MAE
MSE
MAPE

Lesson 3

Smoothing Methods
If we can't predict the noise in the future, we lean on Smoothing Methods to help us predict the future. Also not great if we have a trend.

Moving Average - uses most recent k data values 
MA(3) = most recent 3 values / 3

Smoothed Series
Smoothed observations using the moving average approach
L3 4:20
Yt-k+1

Centered Moving Average
St = (Yt-2 + Yt-1 + Yt + Yt+1 + Yt+2) / 5

Weighted moving average
Previous 3 observations
Ft+1 = (1/6)Yt-2 + (2/6)Yt-1 + (3/6)Yt

5-period (triangle weighted)
St = (1/9)Yt-2 + (2/9)Yt-1 + (3/9)Yt + (2/9)Yt+1 ....

4-period CMA
L3 12:35
use n+1 data points and weight the tails at half

Exponential Smoothing
F2 = Y1
Ft = alpha * Yt + (1-alpha) * Ft
0 < alpha < 1
alpha is our smoothing parameter. you choose alpha to minimize your forecast error

Lesson 4 

Using regression techniques with time as your xn
Linear trend (duh)

Quadratic Trend
y = B0 + B1t + B2t^2 + E
B1 > 0 increasing: B2 > 0 @ increasing rate, B2 < 0 @ decreasing rate
B1 < 0 decreasing: B2 > 0 @ decreasing rate, B2 < 0 @ increasing rate

Exponential Trend
Yt = B0 + B1^t + E -> has to be transformed in order to be plugged in to a regression model. Take the log of both sides

ln yt = ln (b0 + B1^t + E)
ln yt = lnB0 + lnB1^t + lnE

# since ln a^b = b * ln a we can further transform the above equation to

ln yt = lnB0 + t*ln b1 + ln E

ysquiggle = ln y 
B0 squggle = ln B0
etc

B1 as a percentage change per period

The assumption is that E (error) is independent. With seasons, we have correlated residuals (and maybe errors). 

Dummy variable approach to estimating trends with seasons. Dummy = 1 if something is true and 0 otherwise

Example: Quarterly data
w/ k seasons you define k-1 dummies
k = 4
3 dummies

d_Quarter1 = 1 if Qtr = 1, 0 otherwise
d_Quarter2 = 1 if Qtr = 2, 0 otherwise
d_Quarter3 = 1 if.........
Don't have a quarter 4 because then you'd have a collinearity problem

New Model
Yt = B0 + B1(D_Qtr1) + B2(d_Qtr2) + B3(d_Qtr3) + B4t + E

slopes of the lines are always the same when you draw the data on a 2-axis graph

Lesson 5
Additive Decomposition Model 
yt = trendt + seasont + irregulart

In business applications, we often think that seasons lead to percentage changes. Additive decomposition models don't handle this, so we need...

Multiplicative Decomposition Model
yt = trendt * seasonalt * irregulart
irregulart = scaling error

In order to perform trend estimation and forecasting - we need to identify and isolate the seasonal effect. 

De-seasonalize the data:
1) What is our seasonal period?
	Quarters (4 periods)? Months (12 periods)?

2) Develop a moving average forecast (MAF)
	# of periods from 1
	smoothing: you can use a centered moving average
	forecasting: use a regular moving average
	e.g. monthly data w/ annual trends
	12-MA for month 13, 14, 15, etc - this smooths seasonal effects

3) Find the ratio of each observation to the MA forecast
	rt = Yt / St
	i.e. how many percent of our forecast was our observation?

4) Find the average of the ratios for each month, season, or periodic unit
e.g. r13: January, r25:January, r37:January
if there are k periods: you have k average ratios
*unadjusted seasonal indexes*

5) Adjust these
	Divide each k ratios by the average of the k ratios
	This sets the average index to 1 (we a want to on average be multiplying our numbers by 1)
	*Adjusted seasonal indexes*

6) Adjust the series
	For each observation, we divide the observation by its adjusted seasonal index
	sprimet = Yt / index for season of t
	This yeilds a seasonally adjusted series
	St = Trendt * irregulart
	Ysquigglet = Yt / season
	Ysquigglet = B0 + B1t + E
	Trend for period T ~ Tt = b0 + b1t

<a href="https://github.com/yorktronic/hots-comp-calc">Heroes of the Storm (HOTS) team builder</a>

HOTS is a multiplayer online battle arena video game made by Blizzard, the makers of Starcraft, Warcraft, World of Warcraft, Hearthstone, and the upcoming game Overwatch. In competetive play, there is a draft process before each game in which each 5-player team is built. Basically, there are 32 or so total characters to choose from; each player picks a character, and the same character can't be used more than once in a match.

The purpose of the team builder is to use both player preferences, character data, and worldwide match history to predict which character should be selected by a team during each phase of the draft process. 

It's not done yet, so go easy on me!

# Thinkful Data Science Course #

Everything in this folder is related to my coursework as part of Thinkful's Data Science track. I've broken everything up by Unit to make it easier for me to keep track of, and I will only list units that I am working on or have completed.

Some of the code contained herein was created by Thinkful's team as part of their tutorials in different areas. At some point I will go back and comment everything that is theirs, but for the time being this disclaimer is all you'll get.

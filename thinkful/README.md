# Thinkful Data Science Course #

Everything in this folder is related to my coursework as part of Thinkful's Data Science track. I've broken everything up by Unit to make it easier for me to keep track of, and I will only list units that I am working on or have completed.

Please keep in mind that some of the .py files contined in this area were not created by me. This is a learning exercize, not a product that I'm claiming to be mine.

## Unit 1 - The Data Science Toolset ##
* Python
* Git and Github
* SQLite and pandas

## Unit 2 - Analyzing Data ##
